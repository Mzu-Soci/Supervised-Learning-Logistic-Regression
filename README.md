# Supervised-Learning-Logistic-Regression
Create a logistic regression model to classify iris flowers as 'Iris-setosa' or not. Steps: Read data, encode classes, split dataset, fit model, predict, generate confusion matrix, analyze for precision and recall. Optional: Extend to three-class problem for 'Iris-setosa', 'Iris-versicolor', 'Iris-virginica'.
